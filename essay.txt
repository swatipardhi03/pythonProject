The Data Science process
Data Science is mainly used to provide forecasts and trends. It also used to make decisions using tools for predictive analysis, prescriptive analysis, and machine learning.

points:1) Predictive causal analysis
If the data analysis has the purpose of obtaining a prediction that a certain event will occur in the future, it is necessary to apply the predictive causal analysis. Suppose that a bank that provides loans wants to predict the likelihood that customers will repay the loan in the future. In this case, Data Science uses a model that can perform predictive analysis on the customer's payment history to predict whether future payments will be properly received.

points:2) Prescription analysis
On the other hand, if you want to create a model or pattern that applies AI to make decisions autonomously and can constantly update with dynamic self-learning functions, it is certainly necessary to create a prescriptive analysis model. This relatively recent area of Data Science consists of providing advice or directly assuming consequent behavior.

In other words, this model is not only able to predict but suggests or applies a series of prescribed actions. The best example of this is the self-driving car: the data collected by the vehicles are used to optimize the software that drives the car without human intervention. The model will be able to make decisions independently, establishing when to turn, which path to take, when to slow down or break decisively.

points:3) Machine learning to make predictions
If you have, for example, transactional data from a credit card company, and you need to build a model to determine the future trend, you need to use machine learning algorithms through supervised learning. It is called supervised because the data based on which the algorithm can be trained is already available. An example could be the continuous optimization of the voice recognition of Alexa or Google voice assistants.
